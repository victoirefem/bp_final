Using statistical security parameter 40
Significant amount of unused triples of gfp distorting the benchmark. For more accurate benchmarks, consider reducing the batch size with --batch-size.
The following benchmarks are including preprocessing (offline phase).
Time = 4.40963 seconds 
Data sent = 262.837 MB in ~1633 rounds (party 1 only; use '-v' for more details)
Global data sent = 789.871 MB (all parties)
This program might benefit from some protocol options.
Consider adding the following at the beginning of your code:
	program.use_trunc_pr = True
	program.use_edabit(True)
